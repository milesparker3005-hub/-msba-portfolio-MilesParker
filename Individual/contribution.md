I personally contributed toward the preprocessing, modeling, and executive summary. I did the majority of imputations and deciding what columns to remove from the data after looking at missing data. 
I created our LASSO Logistic Regression model (which we did not end up using as our final model). I also did part A of the executive summary and coordinated how to get that completed.

One thing I was a big advocate for was presentation flow. Everyone in our group seemed to have the base concepts of this class down. However, since all of the focus was on the concepts learned in this class,
I wanted to remind everyone about how to structure our presentation so that it flows seamlessly. We have been learning much about that in our other course on Wednesdays so I positioned myself as the guy who would remind 
everyone about Monroe's Motivated Sequence or to present problems, solutions, and call to actions in that order. What we present is half the battle. How we present it is the other half.

Something that completely slipped my mind was to balance the data out when partitioning it into training and testing splits. We noted that our data was unbalanced yet we never thought to balance it during 
partitioning. That is something that other groups did and when I was watching the other presentations, I realized that's something we should have done. If we had more time with this project, I would 
do cluster analysis to further see if we can get more out of the data. That way, we can use our business recommendations in a much more targeted way.
